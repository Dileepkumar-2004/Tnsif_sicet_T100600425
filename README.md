**TNSIF Core Java Training**

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Java programming examples and fundamental concepts developed during the TNSIF training program.

***📂 Project Architecture: src/com/tnsif/***

The source code is categorized into functional areas that transition from basic syntax to advanced concurrency.

**1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)**
   
These folders contain the core pillars of Java design:

*Encapsulation:* Implementation of data hiding using private variables and getters/setters.

*Inheritance:* Examples of code reusability (Single, Multilevel, and Hierarchical).

*Polymorphism:* Demonstrations of Method Overloading (compile-time) and Overriding (runtime).

*interfaces:* Contracts for classes using interface and implements keywords.

**2. Language Fundamentals**
   
Basic building blocks required for any Java application:

*core & controlstate:* Basic syntax, loops (for, while), and decision-making (if-else, switch).

*constructors:* Logic for object initialization.

*operators:* Arithmetic, logical, and relational operations.

*accessmodifiers:* Usage of public, private, protected, and default scopes.

*nonaccessmodifiers*: Usage of static & final.

**3. Data Handling & Utilities**
   
How data is stored, manipulated, and input:

*array & string:* Handling fixed-size collections and immutable text sequences.

*Wrapper:* Converting primitive types into objects (e.g., Integer, Double).

*scanners:* Handling user input via the java.util.Scanner class.

**4. Advanced Java & Collections**
   
Modern Java features for efficiency and data management:

*collections & map:* Implementation of Lists, Sets, and Key-Value pairs.

*exceptions:* Robust error handling using try-catch-finally blocks.

*lamda & streams:* Functional programming patterns introduced in Java 8+ for concise code.

**5. Multi-Threading & Concurrency**
   
Concepts for running multiple tasks simultaneously:

*Threads:* Creating threads by extending the Thread class or implementing Runnable.

*Synchronization:* Managing thread safety and preventing data inconsistency in shared resources.
